Ok, so I wanted to write a product review of all the stuff I used on the AT because I think that's important information, and Amazon never accepts my product reviews. I feel like theres some goodharting going on in Amazon behind the scenes in their product review verification process or something

I thru hiked the AT in spring of 2022: started on March 23rd at Amicalola (iirc) and finished at Katahdin on July 9th (again iirc)

Anyway,

\header1(Shoes: Columbia Redmond v2)
\link(https://www.amazon.com/Columbia-Redmond-Hiking-Pebble-Regular/dp/B07JGDCRZ7/ref=sr_1_8 | Amazon)

\centered(\img(./at-shoes.jpg))

They were like \underline($65) each time I bought them (one before starting the trail and once on the trail)

These are not great shoes lol but the soles (in and out) last forever. In fact, I probably could have walked the \underline(entire) AT without the soles wearing through or the tread fully smoothing out if the sides didn't blow out. Because, well, the sides blow out consistently with these shoes. In their defence, they don't sell Redmond v2 11 wides and I should have been wearing wides, so there was always a constant pressure at the points where the shoes would consistently blow out

I hiked maybe 80 miles in my first pair before going on the AT to break them in. I changed them out in that weird little town in Virginia thats in the valley which is constantly swampy. Just after the icecream place (in Pine Furnace State park?) you head northeast and into this town, take a right at the post office and AT musuem or whatever it was and I changed my first pair of shoes there. I want to say it was like 800 miles in

As seemed to be the consensus by hikers on the AT: the more durable the tread on your shoe, the less grippy they are, and that seemed to be the case in my experience as well. These shoes have supremely durable tread but don't grip very well. Obviously that's a problem because the AT is mega-vertical and requires \italic(grip)

Because the sides busted out, I had to tape and glue and do all sorts of weird stuff to the final pair to keep them together. I don't actually remember what they were like when I went up Katahdin though

\header1(Backpack: Kelty Tioga 5500)
\link(https://www.amazon.com/Kelty-Trekker-Backpack-Garnet-Red/dp/B014JQ9CYK/ref=sr_1_1| Kelty Trekker on Amazon)

\centered(\img(./burdens-disassembled.jpg))
Huh, looks like they don't have the Tioga on Amazon anymore

The Tioga is a massive beast of a pack. Iirc it's like 90L, 5.8lbs and is fully adjustable. You can get it so comfortable with all the adjustments and stuff that you don't feel the extra weight

I ended up blowing a few grommets and ripping it by throwing it off a few cliffs (though I didn't realize it was so fugged up into after getting home because, like I said: its a tank and \italic(also) takes damage really well) so it is currently \italic(retired) and the frame is a wall ornament now. I'll probably fix it at some point, but for now I got myself a new pack: the Gossamer Gear G4-20 which is a completely different kind of pack lol, and just goes to show how much your gear preferences change after hiking 2200+ miles. Specifically, I just can't imagine needing to use anywhere near as much space as I used to. When they say "you really don't need that much stuff" they really aren't kidding. By the end of the AT I basically just had my tent, sitting pad, food, toiletries, battery pack, water filter, extra socks, jacket, and maybe a few other small things; ie: I wouldn't even fill up the G4-20s tiny 30L max. It actually looked kind of funny to put all my stuff in my Tioga because it looked flat, like nothing was in it. It just was so little

\header1(Tent: idk lol)

\centered(\img(./at-tent.jpg))
I don't even know what my tent is. A family member gave it to me as a gift when I was 16 years old, or around then. Its tiny (almost like a bivy), with enough head room to sit up; both of its long sides can be unzipped; it has a rainfly; it leaks like a sieve (sleeping in a literal puddle of water CAN feel good, but it usually doesn't); and slugs have stained it pretty badly. But, I love it \spoiler(and new tents are expensive lol)

Iirc its 3.8 lbs, which isn't too bad

\header1(Hiking / trekking poles: the semi-ubiquitous Cascade Mountain Tech trekking poles)

\centered(\img(./hiking-poles-3.jpg))

I think these were around \icode($30) and wow they're really great trekking poles

Unfortunately, I didn't get the fabled polished cork handles \expandable(constant sweat and friction literally polishes the cork grips so they become shiny, and look like what they are: polished wood); instead, mine just cracked and fell apart. I don't know why

\header1(Blanket: RICHHORSE Down Camping Blanket)
\link(https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08ZNQ73XG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title| Amazon)

\centered(\img(./blanket.jpg))

I think this was actually \icode($30) when I bought it. I picked it up in Virginia in Pearisburg, which is a more or less standard place to do sleeping-gear swaps

Honestly, this is a great blanket; you definitely couldn't survive (at least not comfortably) for very long when its really cold out using this blanket, but its pretty comfortable

I remember the first night after I picked this up, I had sent my sleeping bag back home in the mail and so my future nights sleeps would be entirely on this blanket, and I unpacked it from its bag and I swear it looked like a completely flat black plastic trashbag. I was really worried but slowly it started inflating and eventually grew to be a few inches in thickness

It definitely isn't a cold weather blanket, but it definitely kept me warm enough throughout most of Virginia in late spring, and through to Katahdin. There were a few shelter-stays for me where I was colder than I would have liked, but it really wasn't too bad

It also effectively blocked mosquitos just fine

\header1(Sleeping bag: ???)

\centered(\img(./sleeping-bag.jpg))
\centered(\img(./sleeping-bag-2.jpg))

I have no idea how much this sleeping bag was originally. I've had it for a very long time. I got it when I was a teenager

It says it's like a 30 degree bag, or something, but it really goes much farther down than that. When I got caught in that big snow storm in early April (?) in the Smokeys, I was perfectly warm in it \expandable(Even after I was literally hypothermic a few times and shaking uncontrollably, I just got into my sleeping bag and was fine after a few minutes)

The major problem with it thought: no, not that its heavy (its 4.5 lbs!); but that its super fuckin bulky and you \italic(cannot) get it to squash down smaller. Its has synthetic fiber filling and it just doesn't compress for anything. It compresses so little that if I were to use it with my current G4-20 it actually fills up essentially \underline(the entire) main compartment. Meaning, I actually \underline(can't) use it with my G4-20 because it just takes up too much space. I might be able to get a compression sack for it, but honestly, I'd rather just get a 2.5lb lighter bag that naturally compresses more. I'm poor af though so that'll have to wait

\header1(Cordage: 550 lb, 50' Foot)
\link(https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GWS3I1W/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title|Amazon)

\centered)\img(./food-rope.jpg))

This stuff is great. Its basically indestructible. Holds weight really well and doesn't stretch that much. Its easy to tie and work with. Not too heavy (0.25 lbs)

I have a carabiner permanently attached to it because it exclusively use it to hang food bags

Its great, \underline(however), it gets caught on literally everything as you drag it back to you. Its like its surface is made of velcro and its alive and actually ties itself onto every little fuckin twig and leaf it comes across. I really really hate that. It gets caught on so much stuff I've actually had to climb trees to un-stick it from branches and stuff. 100% this rope is the reason I'm now willing to go with a bear canister lol

\header1(Sitting / sleeping pads: EVA Foam pads)
\link(https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RFFGQM6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title|Amazon)

\centered(\img(./sitting-pads.jpg))

I think these were maybe like $8 when I bought them. They weight absolutely nothing and they're really versatile

When I thru hiked the AT I always had one stuffed between my back and my pack to act as an extra cushion and because it was just a really excellent place to keep one that you could just whip out and sit on. Interestingly, my new G4-20 actually makes use of a closed-cell foam pad as a make-shift pseudo-frame

Highly recommend these things

Oh, also, in that picture above I also have this yellow pad that isn't technically mine. I found it \italic(just) before knifes edge in Pennsylvania. I asked absolutely everyone I came across for a few hundred miles after that point if the pad was theirs. Eventually I just adopted it. If you lost a pad just like that one just before knifes edge in Pennsylvania, I'd love to hear from you!
