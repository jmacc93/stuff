  It's my ideation project

  It's something I've been wanting to make for a long time, but never really knew what it should be, and when I was on the AT \expandable(I thruhiked it from late March \tooltip(2022|Is it really 2022!? That just sounds like the future, to me) to early July 2022) I had plenty of time to think about this \tooltip(project|And all the other projects I want to do) and finally figured out how it should work
  
  In the context of tools for thought, I envision a forum that encourages, and provides the tools for, deliberate and structured accumulation and distillation of ideas. First it is a place for anyone to add their ideas, no matter how ridiculous; it is also a place for people to sift through this \tiny(hopefully large) hoard of ideas for ones that might actually yield something useful; and it is a place for the development of ideas into useful forms
  
  The final \underline(idea) that was the key to how this project should work was simply combining real-time append-only logs \expandable(ie, chat rooms; but that just doesn't sound as good) with wikis; so ideas naturally move from a very transient place to a more permanent place
  
  Check out \link(/pages/ideation-project.html|this page for more information about this project)

\header1(Why \italic(append-only logs) suck for idea retention in a community)

Because the chat messages fuckin dissapear lol. They go up the screen and then poof they might as well be gone. The number of eyes on them is tiny after they go out of the chat viewport

So places like Discord, irc, etc, and even Reddit, and more traditional forums, are all out as effective idea-sharing platforms

Ideally, there is some location on the platform, associated with any given topic, that is devoted to saving what the \tooltip(community|And individuals too) wants to save

\header1(Why \italic(wikis) suck for idea generation)

Because they're \tooltip(too slow|The idea-in-mind to idea-on-page cycle should be as fast as possible), too \tooltip(asynchronous|If people are doing things at the same time, and sharing information in real time, then they are synchronized. If people aren't synchronized then the platform is asynchronous), and they retain their information for too long

Actually, originally, I considered a really polished real-time-collaborative rich text editor as an ideation platform, but although that solves the slow and asynchronous issues, it still causes a build-up of information \expandable(That is almost certainly mostly low quality, which is as it should be and isn't an issue; a good collaborative ideation platform should be able to handle diminishing low quality ideas without harming high quality ones)

A chat doesn't have this issue though. A chat is \tiny(hopefully) fast for getting ideas down, synchronous between users, and automatically diminishes old ideas. But really, the mind-to-paper speed, synchronicity, and idea-diminishing of chats aren't specific to chats, but real-time append-only logs in general. You don't have to actually be chatting with another person to benefit from an append-only log. A single user might utilize an append-only log \tooltip(of their own|That others can't add to) that others can watch in real-time, and that would be essentially as good as a chat in terms of getting ideas down, synchronicity,etc

\header1(Chats and wikis are different \tooltip(tools|Duh! That's coming full circle to what's already obvious... But for idea generation it isn't necessarily obvious in some particular ways))

\list(
  \item(Append-only logs are good for getting things down, and ignoring what you've already got down. They are dynamic)
  \item(Wikis are good for recording things you want to reference later, and connecting ideas. They are static)
)

So why tf can't we just juxtapose them to combine what they are into better package?

That's what I'm now working on.

But...

\header1(An even \tooltip(better|Hopefully) platform)

Here's a list of more features that I've actually already implemented in the ideation forum I'm currently working on:
\list(
  \item(Seamless and ultra-low-cost \tooltip(topic|A topic, in its most abstract form, is a container and associated toolbox for ideas related to whatever humans associate with the label given the topic; the exact tools within the toolbox, and the form of the container aren't definite) generation \expandable(In its current form, that looks like calling a textcmd \icode(\new(topic| topic-label-here)), and probably clicking a button, later). This encourages spawning new topics for dealing with particular ideas specifically)
  \item(Personal vs community ideation. It's not all about chatting and whatnot; I also want a platform where users can isolate themselves from others and still have the platform's form and tools be effective. \expandable(In its current form, a \icode(RemoteServer) is equivalent to a \icode(LocalServer), and the associated elements in each are styled differently, but function equivalently (or at least they should)))
  \item(\lowvis(... and more, when I decide to write about it))
