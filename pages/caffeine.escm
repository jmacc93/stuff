\title(caffeine)I have ADHD and I've had \italic(extreme) success using caffeine to manage it. Other drugs I've tried haven't been effective or been counter-effective

Here's my current dosage schedule / whatever:
  * As soon as I get up (like 7am-ish) I take 100 mg
  * Around 1pm I take another 100 mg

I used to believe you develop too much of a tolerance for it to be effective using it every day like this. But my personal experience is that it is still effective at stopping (or at least dulling) most ADHD behaviors (loss of attention, spaztic thoughtpatterns / movement patterns, etc)

I used to take far less than I currently do, and it took me awhile to ramp up to this quantity, but I think its a good quantity to take
