\title(music)

I like at least a little bit of every genre of music. However, most music is \italic(terrible). In the best case, a genre is 80%/20% terrible/good. Of the remaining good proportion, 80% is 20% of the quality, the remaining 20% is 80% of the quality. Or whatever. Music genres follow this distribution which seems something like \math(q(a^r) = b^r) or whatever. Also note: this distribution is different for every individual. The list of the music I've relatively recently saved below is going to sound really bad to many people, and in turn I would probably think their music sounds bad. But generally I would expect something like 20% of their selection to sound ok, and 20% of my selection to sound ok for them (more or less)

Also, some genres suck ass though lol. For instance, dubstep is generally terrible. Its distribution is something like 95%/5% for me. But of the high quality 5%, there are some genuinely good songs in there

What I currently have saved \expandable(My latest music-saving scheme is I use raindrop and just save pages with music on them into raindop when I run into them) \expandable(Note: I don't actually know if any of these are good, I just saved them. My tastes may have even changed so radically in just the relatively little while since I saved them that I think they're terrible now), in no particular order (\colored(red|warning), \colored(red|warning), some links below may be links to \underline(\italic(youtube))):
