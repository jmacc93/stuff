This is a really basic use of textcommand

Every \bold(textcommand) starts with a \tooltip(slash|Backslash? Forward slash? Idk) like \icode(\bold(this)). That renders as \bold(this)

\header1(Cmdsets)

A \icode(cmdset) is a set of commands,
I think I programmed a \icode(cmdset element) like:
\code(js|
type CmdsetElement = {
  preprocess?: (subtree: PTE) => PTE,           // transforms subtree to subtree, optional
  evaluate:    (body: any)    => any | Promise<any>, // result of child evaluation to the intended output
  check?:      (body: string) => boolean,       // is given body free of errors?
  stopsParser?: boolean                         // for textcmds like \comment and \code
}
)
Uhh, buts that's too much detail for this page

A \underline(cmdset) is just a list of textcommands. \tooltip(Itc|in the context) of my stuff page, I usually will say cmdset when refering to the \italic(basic cmdset) which is the standard set of commands like \icode(\bold, \italic, etc) seen here

I programmed my textcmd library to be relatively modular in the sense that the main library \icode(textcmd.js) doesn't include any cmdsets. But then another library \icode(basic-textcmds.js) \underline(does) include a cmdset, and that cmdset is the basic cmdset...

Anyway...
