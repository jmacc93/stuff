      <p>This page uses javascript to retrieve and render markup of various types and basically won't work without it</p>
      <p>My /stuff/ blog isn't monetized, it doesn't use tracking scripts or anything, and I don't use javascript for anything but page functionality</p>
      <p>You *can* view the raw markup by removing just the <code style="background: lightgray">/stuff/misc/frontend.html?</code> from the url, but ymmv (I think your browser will just download .escm files, for instance)</p>
      <p>I can't force you to turn on javascript for this site, but it really doesn't make much sense to not use it (unless you can't, haha; lynx fans unite!)</p>
