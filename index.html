I'll just put whatever I want in here

Like a demonstration of \link(/stuff/pages/textcmd-demo.html|textcmds) \expandable(
  Textcmds are a \strikeout(programming language \expandable(maybe?)) markup language that looks like:
  \code(text|
    \expandable(\bold(this)) \rainbow(<- that's an expandable)
  )
  Which renders as:
  \expandable(\bold(this)) \rainbow(<- that's an expandable)

I'm working on something much more powerful \expandable(
  It's my ideation project

  It's something I've been wanting to make for a long time, but never really knew what it should be, and when I was on the AT \expandable(I thruhiked it from late March \tooltip(2022|Is it really 2022!? That just sounds like the future, to me) to early July 2022) I had plenty of time to think about this \tooltip(project|And all the other projects I want to do) and finally figured out how it should work
  
  In the context of tools for thought, I envision a forum that encourages, and provides the tools for, deliberate and structured accumulation and distillation of ideas. First it is a place for anyone to add their ideas, no matter how ridiculous; it is also a place for people to sift through this \tiny(hopefully large) hoard of ideas for ones that might actually yield something useful; and it is a place for the development of ideas into useful forms
  
  The final \underline(idea) that was the key to how this project should work was simply combining real-time append-only logs \expandable(ie, chat rooms; but that just doesn't sound as good) with wikis; so ideas naturally move from a very transient place to a more permanent place
  
  Check out \link(/stuff/pages/ideation-project.html|this page for more information about this project)
). That project was actually what spawned textcmds: because I wanted more power than markdown affords

I also want to put some of the results from me messing around with stable diffusion here. Later, though. \lowvis(Unless I've already done it ðŸ˜Œ)

Here's my \link(/stuff/pages/day-posts.html|Posts by day). Not every day, but miscellaneous things are found there
